# :small_red_triangle: Debugo

*An optimized debug library for go*

Debugo is a dead simple debugging library that doesn't increase your programs size thanks to the compiler optimizations.

## Installation

```
go get github.com/negrel/debugo
```

## Hello world

**debugo.Assert** is a function that assert the given bool and panic if it is not true.

Take a look at the following example :

![example](https://github.com/negrel/debugo/raw/master/.github/carbon.png?sanitize=true)

Let's run the program:

```
go run .
'Hello world!' == 'Bye Bye' is false
```

As you can see, no panic was triggered because the **debugo.Assert** function was not executed. The function was **removed** when the program was compiled.

Let's run the program with the debugo tag:
```
go run -tags debugo .
'Hello world!' == 'Bye Bye' is false
panic: error, the given string are not equal

goroutine 1 [running]:
github.com/negrel/debugo.Assert(...)
        /home/negrel/code/golang/src/github.com/negrel/beta/vendor/github.com/negrel/debugo/assert_d.go:10
main.main()
        /home/negrel/code/golang/src/github.com/negrel/beta/main.go:17 +0x146
exit status 2
```

Now the program panic because the compiler include the **debugo.Assert** function.

If we take a look at the **Static Single Assignment**, we will notice that the **debugo** function are removed by the compiler.
